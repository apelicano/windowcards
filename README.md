# 4-Digit Addition Window Cards Generator

This is a lightweight, printer-friendly web app for generating randomized **addition window card worksheets** for Grade 5 students and similar learners. It helps reinforce vertical addition skills — especially multi-digit arithmetic with carry-over.

Teachers can easily generate, print, and reuse cleanly formatted problem sets — with or without answers — in a flexible grid layout.
