### ✅ Summary

You now have:

* A clean **modular app** with saved preferences
* **Dynamic title and font scaling** for digital and print use
* **Print headers** to simulate store-bought work cards
* Easy **customization and scalability** (can expand to subtraction or other operations later)

 
## ✅ Features Requirements Checklist (v3)
 - Header revision: Style the print only header as (evenly spaced across page width) single row specified as:  
   - ```Name: ____ Grade: ____ Date: ____```
 - adjustable font size control next to `print` buttton; lower limit on font size should allow for 10 by 10 grids compactly laid out for a single A4 page.
 - limit number of digits of addends to 6, e.g., 0 to 999,999
  - for each problem, add horizontal row of "=" signs under the addends, e.g., 
   - current layout:
```
   94,978
+  32,375
= 127,353
```
   - revised layout: 
```
   94,978
+  32,375
  =======
= 127,353
```
